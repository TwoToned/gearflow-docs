# Warehouse Operations

## UI Terminology
- "Check Out" is displayed as **"Deploy"** in the UI
- "Check In" is displayed as **"Return"** in the UI
- `CHECKED_OUT` status displays as **"Deployed"**
- Internal code (function names, enum values, API params) still uses `checkOut`/`checkIn`/`CHECKED_OUT`

## Three-Phase Warehouse Flow

The warehouse uses a Pick/Prep → Deploy → Return flow. Items are **prepped** (packed) before being **deployed** (checked out).

### Pick/Prep Tab
- Scan or select items to prep
- Container dropdown next to scan input — select a case asset or type a custom container name
- Container assets (from configured case category) auto-added to project on first prep
- `prepItemDirect()` sets `prepStatus=PACKED` and `prepContainer` without deploying (status stays `CONFIRMED`)
- **Unified split approach**: both serialized and bulk multi-qty items use the same split pattern:
  - When prepping 1 unit from a qty > 1 item, a new qty=1 line item is created with `prepStatus=PACKED`
  - For serialized items: the split item gets the assigned `assetId`
  - For bulk items: the split item inherits the `bulkAssetId`
  - The original item's `quantity` decrements by 1
  - When original reaches qty=0, it's hidden from the prep tab
  - When original reaches qty=1, the last unit is prepped in-place (no split)
- Items with no check items assigned are prepped directly; items with checks go through the check queue
- **Sub-hire items skip the asset picker**: When `handlePrepSelected()` processes selected items, it checks `!li.isSubhire` before routing a serialized item (no `assetId`, no `bulkAssetId`, SERIALIZED model) to the asset picker. Sub-hire items are third-party gear with no internal asset record, so they are prepped directly without asset assignment.
- Bulk items display as expandable groups with individual unit rows (Unit 1, Unit 2, etc.) — each unit gets its own check dialog
- `deprepItem()` reverses prep: clears `prepStatus` to PENDING (split items stay as independent line items)

### Deploy Tab
- Shows items with `prepStatus=PACKED` and `quantity > 0` (prepped but not yet deployed)
- Split items (qty=1) flow through the serialized deploy path regardless of whether they have a `bulkAssetId`
- Items grouped by `prepContainer` with section headers (Package icon + container name)
- X button on container headers to clear container assignment
- Container line items auto-deploy when all contents are deployed (`syncContainerStatus`)
- Permanent accessories (`childKind === "ACCESSORY"`) of a scanned asset render as read-only indented rows under the parent via `AccessoryChildRows` (`deploy` mode shows not-yet-out accessories). They cascade atomically with the parent — no separate scan/verify. See [Child Assets / Accessories](./48-child-assets-accessories.md).

### Return Tab
- Shows items with `status === "CHECKED_OUT"` only
- Split bulk items (qty=1 with bulkAssetId) use the serialized return path
- Items grouped by `prepContainer` with section headers (same as Deploy tab)
- Container line items auto-return when all contents are returned (`syncContainerStatus`)
- Accessory children render as read-only indented rows via `AccessoryChildRows` (`return` mode shows currently-deployed accessories), mirroring the Deploy tab. See [Child Assets / Accessories](./48-child-assets-accessories.md).

### Bulk Check-In Tab
A project-wide accessory totals view for accessory-heavy jobs (50 lights = 100
clamps + 50 TrueCons). Instead of returning each parent's accessories per
parent, it aggregates every **deployed accessory child** (`childKind: ACCESSORY`)
across the whole project into per-identity totals — bulk by `bulkAssetId`,
serialised by `modelId` — and lets the operator check a counted quantity in with
one action. The count is distributed deterministically back across the
underlying child line items via the canonical `returnLineUnits` primitive (the
same one the per-parent Return path uses). Over-return is rejected, empty/zero
submits are no-ops, and repeated partial returns accumulate safely. Additive and
parallel to the Return tab — the per-parent flow is unchanged. See
[Bulk Check-In Totals](./52-bulk-checkin.md).

### Scan Flow
- `quickAddAndCheckOut()` adds items to project and **preps** them (sets `status: "CONFIRMED"`, `prepStatus: "PACKED"`) — does NOT deploy directly
- `lookupAssetForScan()` treats scanned serialized assets as serialized (not bulk) even if the matching line item has qty > 1

### Kit/Prep-Kit Flows
- Kit checkout: `checkOutKit()` — atomic transaction updating kit + all member assets + grandchildren
- Kit checkin: `checkInKit()` — same pattern, handles grandchildren and prep-kit assets
- For prep-kit: same `checkOutKit` flow via `ProjectLineItem.assetId` (not `KitSerializedItem`)

## Return Flow (Check In)
1. User selects items to return, specifies condition per item
2. `checkInItems` based on condition:
   - GOOD → asset status `AVAILABLE`, disconnects `assetId` from line item
   - DAMAGED → asset status `IN_MAINTENANCE`, disconnects
   - MISSING → asset status `LOST`, disconnects
3. For kit/prep-kit: `checkInKit` atomically reverses deployment
4. Returning a parent asset cascades the return to its permanent accessories via `checkinAccessoryChildren` (`line-item-fulfillment.ts`) — shared, so both `checkInItems` AND the **check-and-store** flow (`completeCheckAndStore`) release the accessories; de-prep also clears them from the deploy-staging board. On a multi-quantity model line, the cascade is **scoped to the returned unit** (`returnedAssetId`): serialised accessories return only with their own host asset, and the shared bulk accessory clears one unit's share per return, fully releasing once every host unit is back. The cascade only fires when the parent return actually flipped a unit (`unitsFlipped > 0`), so re-scanning an already-returned unit can't double-return the shared accessory. See [Child Assets / Accessories](./48-child-assets-accessories.md).

## Kit Verification
Before deploying or returning a kit (or prep-kit) with unverified items:
- Confirmation dialog shows "X/Y items verified — deploy/return anyway?"
- Verification circles are **clickable** for manual toggle on all children and grandchildren
- `verifiedKitItems` Set tracks confirmed line item IDs
- Checked on all 4 code paths: checkbox deploy, checkbox return, scan deploy, scan return
- `collectAllVerifiableIds(children, mode)` filters by mode: deploy counts non-CHECKED_OUT items, return counts CHECKED_OUT items — so the X/Y badge reflects only relevant items

## Kit Groups in Deploy/Return Tabs
Kits and prep-kits appear as expandable groups in the Deploy and Return tabs. Uses `kit-group` GroupEntry variant. Parent line item has `kitId` set, children have `isKitChild: true`. Checkbox selection routes to `kitCheckOutMutation`/`kitCheckInMutation`.

### Nested Kit Rendering (`KitChildRows`)
Children of a kit/prep-kit that are themselves kits render with:
- Chevron expand/collapse toggle
- Container icon + Kit badge
- Their own indented children (grandchildren) at deeper indent level
- Clickable verification circles on all levels

### Asset Tag Display
- Regular kits: show their asset tag
- Prep-kits with case asset: show the case asset tag
- Auto-generated `PREP-*` tags: hidden (display `—`)

## Prep Containers
Container dropdown on Pick/Prep tab for visual asset grouping. See [Preps](./32-preps.md) for full details.

## Partial Deploy/Return
Kits and prep-kits support partial deployment:
- When not all children are verified, confirmation dialog offers "Deploy Verified Only" or "Deploy All"
- "Deploy Verified" uses `checkOutItems` (individual line items) instead of `checkOutKit` (atomic)
- Partially deployed kits appear in BOTH deploy and return tabs with filtered children per tab
- `KitChildRows` accepts `mode` prop (`"deploy"` or `"return"`) to filter grandchildren per tab
- Parent line item is included in partial deploy only if not already `CHECKED_OUT`
- Nested kit parent line items are automatically included when any of their grandchildren are being deployed verified
- All 4 filter layers (checkOutItemsList, checkedOutItems, groupItems, groupCheckinItems) are grandchild-aware
- `checkOutItems` skips already-deployed line items (status `CHECKED_OUT`) during partial re-deploy instead of throwing

## Availability Checks
When adding assets/kits to projects:
- **Serialized assets**: Only `RETIRED` and `LOST` statuses are blocked. `CHECKED_OUT` assets can still be added.
- **Kits**: Only `IN_MAINTENANCE` and `INCOMPLETE` statuses are blocked. `CHECKED_OUT` kits can still be added.
- This allows planning future projects while equipment is deployed on current ones.

## Conflict Detection
`lookupAssetForScan` checks both line item status AND physical asset status. If asset is `CHECKED_OUT` on another project, returns error with project name/number.

## Checkout Safety Invariants
Two invariants `checkOutItems` enforces (see `warehouse-tenant-tt-safety.int.test.ts`):

- **Org-scoped asset writes.** The asset id used for a serialised checkout can come from the untrusted scan payload (`item.assetId`), so it is re-scoped to the caller's org with `findFirst({ id, organizationId })` before any write; a miss throws "Asset not found in this organization". The status/location mutation is an org-scoped `updateMany` (defense-in-depth), as is the accessory-cascade asset write in `checkoutAccessoryChildren`. Without this a caller could flip another tenant's asset status/location by scanning its id onto their own line.
- **Accessories are T&T-gated.** The top-level T&T preflight (`assertTestTagAllowsCheckout`) only sees the scanned parent lines + their units. Accessory children are **separate line items** with their own ids/units (materialised at prep time on different line ids, or at scan time *after* the preflight runs), so they never reach the top-level gate. `checkoutAccessoryChildren` therefore runs its own `assertTestTagAllowsCheckout` over the accessory children's asset/bulk ids before flipping them — a failed/overdue accessory throws `TestTagBlockError` and rolls back the whole batch. The gate is scoped to children that are **not already `CHECKED_OUT`** (mirroring the cascade's skip-already-out guards) so an already-shipped sibling accessory whose T&T lapsed doesn't block a later partial deploy of the same multi-quantity parent line. (A not-yet-deployed sibling accessory is still gated, since the line-scoped cascade would flip it — true per-unit scoping is the deferred "snapshot per-unit accessory contributions" follow-up.) See [Child Assets / Accessories](./48-child-assets-accessories.md).

## Cross-Navigation
- **Warehouse → Project**: "View Project" button in warehouse header links to `/projects/[id]`
- **Project → Warehouse**: "Warehouse" button in project header links to `/warehouse/[id]`

## Custom Items in Warehouse

Custom line items (`isCustomItem: true`) appear in all three warehouse tabs with a muted "Custom" badge. They have no asset tag and cannot be scanned — operators check them out/in via the existing button/checkbox mechanism.

**Pick/Prep:** Custom items appear in the pick/prep list. They can be manually marked as Packed (same checkbox as bulk items). No scanning required.

**Deploy:** Custom items appear in the deploy list. Since `isBulk` check (`!lineItem.assetId && lineItem.quantity > 1`) routes them to the bulk checkout path, all units deploy at once via button press.

**Free-text / custom lines cannot carry asset tags (intended).** A line with no catalog model (`modelId: null`, including `isCustomItem` lines) deploys generically: `lookupAssetForScan` binds a scanned asset to a line by matching `modelId`, so a model-less line can never have a physical asset assigned, and `checkOutItems` falls through to the "deploy whole line" branch (flips status, no unit, no asset). Consequence: such a line shows **no per-unit asset tags on the delivery docket** — only its name + quantity — even with `showPerUnitCheckboxes` on. This is by design: free-text lines are for ad-hoc/consumable items (cables, gaffer). Serialised gear that needs asset-tag tracking must be entered as a **catalog model**, not typed by name. (Product decision 2026-05-30: keep free-text non-tracked rather than override the scan match or add a line→model link flow.)

**Return:** Custom items appear in the return list. They are returned via the return button; no asset tag scan possible.

**Checkout server path:** `checkOutItems()` handles custom items without changes — null `assetId` + qty=1 takes the serialized path (skips asset status checks), qty>1 takes the bulk path (deploys full quantity).

**Scan conflict:** Custom items have no barcode. If an operator scans a barcode that doesn't match any asset, the existing "not found" error is returned — no conflict with custom items.

## Force Return
When assets or kits are stuck in `CHECKED_OUT` status (e.g., project deleted while items deployed, data inconsistency), "Force Return" buttons allow resetting them to `AVAILABLE`:

### Server Actions (`src/server/warehouse.ts`)
- **`forceReturnAsset(assetId)`** — Finds all CHECKED_OUT line items for the asset across all projects, sets them to RETURNED, resets asset status to AVAILABLE, restores default location (or null). Also dissolves any prep-kits using this asset as a case.
- **`forceReturnKit(kitId)`** — For regular kits: resets kit + all children (including nested kits and grandchildren) to AVAILABLE, sets all related line items to RETURNED, always resets location (even to null). For prep-kits: dissolves entirely (un-parents children, deletes Kit record, returns `{ deleted: true }`).
- **`bulkForceReturnAssets(assetIds)`** — Batch force return for multiple assets in one transaction.

### UI Locations
- **Asset detail page** (`/assets/registry/[id]`): Force Return button in header, visible when `status === "CHECKED_OUT"`
- **Kit detail page** (`/kits/[id]`): Force Return button in header, visible when `status === "CHECKED_OUT"`. Redirects to `/kits` if prep-kit was dissolved.
- **Model detail page** (`/assets/models/[id]`): Per-row Force Return icon button in serialized assets table for each `CHECKED_OUT` asset
- **Asset list page**: Bulk Force Return button in selection bar
- **Kit list page**: Bulk Force Return button in selection bar
- All use `confirm()` pattern, amber text color, `RotateCcw` icon
- Permission: `warehouse.check_in`

## Documents
The warehouse page has a "Documents" dropdown with access to all project PDFs (Pull Slip, Delivery Docket, Return Sheet, Quote, Invoice) — same documents available on the project detail page.

### Deployment-Aware Filtering
- **Delivery Docket**: Only shows deployed items. Kit/prep-kit children are filtered to CHECKED_OUT only. Nested kit grandchildren are also filtered to CHECKED_OUT.
- **Return Sheet**: Only shows deployed/returned items. Kit children filtered to CHECKED_OUT or RETURNED. Nested grandchildren similarly filtered.
- **Pull Slip**: Shows all non-cancelled items. Already-deployed items display with a filled checkbox (tick) instead of an empty one. Bulk per-unit rows tick the first N units matching `checkedOutQuantity`. Kit children and nested grandchildren also show ticked/unticked based on their deployment status.
- **Quote / Invoice**: Show all items regardless of deployment status (for pricing).

### Total Item Counts
- **Pull Slip** and **Delivery Docket** display a "Total Items" count in the header info section.
- Kit/prep-kit parents are NOT counted as 1 — instead, all individual children and nested kit grandchildren are counted.
- Delivery docket counts only deployed children (`CHECKED_OUT`). Pull slip counts all children.

## Online Pick List
Dialog with full item list showing deployment status per line item. Mobile full-screen with safe area padding. Kit and prep-kit groups show as expandable sections with children. Permanent accessories render indented under their parent asset line, badged "Accessory", and count toward pick progress (`pick-list-progress.ts`) — the same rows appear on the printable pull sheet (`pull-sheet/page.tsx`). See [Child Assets / Accessories](./48-child-assets-accessories.md).

## Warehouse Dashboard Display (TV Screen)

### Overview
A public, token-authenticated dashboard page designed for wall-mounted TVs/monitors in the warehouse. Shows today's dispatch, returns, prep status, and upcoming schedule. Dark background, large text readable from 3+ metres, auto-refreshes every 60 seconds, no interactive elements.

### Data Model
`WarehouseDashboardToken` — stores access tokens scoped to an organization and optional location. Fields: `name`, `token` (raw hex token for URL display), `tokenHash` (SHA-256, unique, for lookup), `locationId` (optional location scope), `layout` ("standard", "compact", "dispatch-only"), `isActive`, `createdById`, `lastAccessedAt`.

### Access
- URL pattern: `/warehouse/display/{token}` (64-char hex token)
- Token is generated in Settings > Displays
- URL is viewable any time via the edit dialog (raw token stored in DB)
- No login required — added to middleware public routes
- API endpoint: `GET /api/warehouse/display/{token}` returns JSON data

### Settings UI
`/settings/displays` — create, list, edit, and revoke display tokens. Each token has a name, optional warehouse location scope, and layout selection.
- **Create**: Shows URL on creation with copy button
- **Edit** (pencil icon): Change name, location, and layout. Shows current display URL with copy button. Regenerate URL button (invalidates old URL, generates new one).
- **Revoke** (trash icon): Deletes the token permanently

### Display Layouts
| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **standard** | Full dashboard: dispatch, returns, prep status, 7-day upcoming, alerts |
| **compact** | Dispatch + returns only, larger text |
| **dispatch-only** | Today's dispatch with large prep status cards |

### Dashboard Sections
- **Today's Dispatch**: Projects with delivery services or loadIn/rentalStart today. Shows delivery time, destination, vehicle, pack progress (green/amber/red).
- **Returns Due Today**: Projects with pickup services or loadOut/rentalEnd today. Shows due time and expected item count.
- **Prep Status**: Compact cards for projects being prepped (CONFIRMED/PREPPING). Shows packed/total items with progress bar.
- **Upcoming (7 days)**: Day grid showing dispatch and return counts per day.
- **Alerts**: Unprepped dispatches, partially packed dispatches, overdue returns.

### Server Actions (`src/server/warehouse-display.ts`)
- `getDisplayTokens()` — list tokens for the org (includes raw token for URL display)
- `createDisplayToken({ name, locationId?, layout? })` — generates token, stores raw + hash, returns raw token + record
- `updateDisplayToken(id, { name?, locationId?, layout? })` — update display settings
- `regenerateDisplayToken(id)` — generates new token (invalidates old URL), returns new raw token
- `revokeDisplayToken(id)` — deletes the token
- `getWarehouseDisplayData(orgId, locationId?)` — assembles all dashboard data
- `validateDisplayToken(rawToken)` — hash-validates, updates lastAccessedAt

### Integration Points
- Services: Delivery/pickup services drive dispatch/return sections, falls back to project dates
- Location scoping: Tokens with `locationId` filter to projects at that location
- Activity log: Token creation/revocation logged
- Middleware: `/warehouse/display/` and `/api/warehouse/display/` are public routes
