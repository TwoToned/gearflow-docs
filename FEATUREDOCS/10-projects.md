# Project & Rental Management

## Status Flow
```
ENQUIRY → QUOTING → QUOTED → CONFIRMED → PREPPING → CHECKED_OUT → ON_SITE → RETURNED → COMPLETED → INVOICED
                                                                                        ↗
                                           Any status → CANCELLED ─────────────────────┘
```

## Project Hierarchy
```
Project
  → ProjectCategory (top-level organiser: "RF", "IEM", "PA")
      → ProjectGroup (billable unit: title, description, qty, price)
          → ProjectLineItem (equipment tracking only, not on quote)
      → ProjectLineItem (standalone, appears as its own line item)
  → ProjectLineItem (uncategorized)
  → ProjectService (direct cost roll-up)
  → CrewAssignment (direct cost roll-up)
  → ProjectManager (multi-PM via join table)
```

## Project Managers
- Multi-PM support via `ProjectManager` join table (replaces old single `projectManagerId`)
- Managed on the project detail page sidebar via `ProjectManagersPanel`
- Add/remove PMs via `addProjectManager()` / `removeProjectManager()` in `src/server/project-managers.ts`
- PMs shown as avatar row in project header

## Financial Calculations (`recalculateProjectTotals()`)
```
equipmentRevenue = SUM(group.price × group.quantity) + SUM(standalone.lineTotal)
serviceCostTotal = SUM(service.costTotal) where billableToClient = false
labourCostTotal = SUM(assignment.estimatedCost)

subtotal = equipmentRevenue
discountAmount = subtotal × discountPercent / 100
taxRate = project.taxRate ?? org.defaultTaxRate ?? 10
taxableAmount = subtotal - discountAmount
taxAmount = taxableAmount × taxRate / 100
total = taxableAmount + taxAmount

margin = total - (serviceCostTotal + labourCostTotal)
marginPercent = margin / total × 100
```

### Tax Rate Cascade
- Per-project `taxRate` (Decimal, nullable) takes priority
- Falls back to `Organization.defaultTaxRate` (configurable in Settings)
- Falls back to 10% (GST default)

### Billing Weeks/Days Pricing (Primary Model)
- `Project.billingWeeks` (Int, nullable) + `Project.billingDays` (Int, nullable) — set on project form
- Per-group override: `ProjectGroup.billingWeeks` + `billingDays`
- Uses `Model.weeklyRate` and `Model.dailyRate` fields
- Formula: `(weeklyRate × weeks + dailyRate × days) × quantity`
- "Match" button on project form auto-calculates weeks/days from rental date range

### Legacy Rental Period Pricing (Fallback)
- `Project.defaultRentalPeriod` (DAILY | WEEKLY) + `defaultRentalQuantity` (Int)
- Per-group override: `ProjectGroup.rentalPeriod` + `rentalQuantity`
- Used only when billingWeeks/billingDays are both null
- Formula: `rate × quantity × rentalQuantity`

## Categories (`ProjectCategory`)
- Top-level organiser for equipment (e.g. "RF", "IEM", "PA")
- Sort order via `sortOrder` field, drag-and-drop reorderable
- Deleting a category orphans its groups and line items into the
  Uncategorized zone (FK is `ON DELETE SET NULL` for both
  `ProjectGroup.categoryId` and `ProjectLineItem.categoryId` — the
  group FK switched from CASCADE to SET NULL in v0.10.0.0 so deleting
  a category no longer destroys its groups along with every contained
  line item)
- Server actions: `src/server/project-categories.ts`

## Groups (`ProjectGroup`) — The Billable Unit
- Groups are the billable units on quotes/invoices
- Fields: `title`, `description` (free-text for quote), `quantity`, `price`
- `categoryId` is **nullable since v0.10.0.0** — a group can live in
  the project's Uncategorized zone (mirrors `SubHireGroup.targetCategoryId`).
  The toolbar "Add Group" dialog and per-group Move dialog both offer
  Uncategorized as a destination. `createProjectGroup` scopes its
  `sortOrder` aggregate by `projectId` so each project's Uncategorized
  zone has its own sequence.
- `suggestedPrice` auto-calculated from tracked assets' rates inside the group
- User can override `price` or accept the suggestion with one click
- Assets inside a group are for **tracking only** — never shown on quotes
- Groups only exist within a project, not as standalone library items

### Group Templates
- Save a group configuration as a reusable template (`GroupTemplate` + `GroupTemplateItem`)
- Apply a template when creating a new group (pre-fills line items from template)
- Template picker integrated in the inline "Add Group" form
- Server actions: `src/server/group-templates.ts`
- Standalone management page at `/settings/group-templates` (linked from
  the Settings sidebar and reachable via `@grouptemplates` in cmd+K)
- Full integration-checklist coverage: `requirePermission(project, ...)` on
  all server actions, `logActivity` on every write, global search,
  page-commands entry, org export/import (`GroupTemplate` +
  `GroupTemplateItem`).
- Notifications: `// FEATUREDOCS/29: N/A — templates are static config
  with no time-based triggers (no expiry, no scheduled state changes)`.
- CSV: `// FEATUREDOCS/29: N/A — templates are hand-curated and small in
  number; bulk CSV import/export would add complexity without a real
  use case`.

### Suggested Price Calculation (`calculateSuggestedPrice()`)
```
# Primary: billing weeks/days (when billingWeeks or billingDays is set)
weeks = group.billingWeeks ?? project.billingWeeks ?? 0
days  = group.billingDays  ?? project.billingDays  ?? 0
For each line item in group (excluding kit children):
  total += (model.weeklyRate × weeks + model.dailyRate × days) × item.quantity

# Fallback: legacy rental period
rentalPeriod = group.rentalPeriod ?? project.defaultRentalPeriod ?? "DAILY"
rentalQuantity = group.rentalQuantity ?? project.defaultRentalQuantity ?? 1
For each line item in group (excluding kit children):
  rate = (rentalPeriod === "WEEKLY") ? model.weeklyRate : model.dailyRate
  total += rate × item.quantity × rentalQuantity
```
- Recalculated when: items added/removed, billing period changed, item moved between groups

## Line Items (`ProjectLineItem`)
- `categoryId` (nullable FK → ProjectCategory)
- `groupId` (nullable FK → ProjectGroup)
- Items in a group are for equipment tracking only
- Standalone items (no groupId) appear as their own line items on quotes

### Line Item Types
- **EQUIPMENT**: Links to `modelId`, optionally `assetId`, `bulkAssetId`, or `kitId`
- **SERVICE / LABOUR / TRANSPORT / MISC**: No asset link, just description + pricing
- **Custom Items** (`isCustomItem: true`, type stays `EQUIPMENT`): Free-text items with no inventory reference. Set via "Custom Item" button in equipment tab. The `description` field serves as the display name. Shown with a muted "Custom" badge. Skips all availability checks and merge logic. Appears on all documents and in warehouse views.

### Custom Items
Custom items are ad-hoc line items for gear not in the system — borrowed equipment, client-supplied items, one-off rentals tracked informally. They live as regular `ProjectLineItem` records with `isCustomItem: true` and no `modelId`/`assetId`/`bulkAssetId` link.

**Behavior:**
- Created via `addCustomLineItem()` in `src/server/line-items.ts`
- Validated by `customLineItemSchema` in `src/lib/validations/line-item.ts`
- Display name: `description` field (already used as fallback across all rendering paths)
- `computeOverbookedStatus` skips custom items (filters on `li.modelId !== null`)
- Never merged with other items (merge logic requires `modelId`)
- Appear in warehouse (pick/prep, deploy, return tabs) — checked out/in via button, no scan
- Appear on all PDFs (`getProjectForDocument` fetches all non-cancelled items regardless of type)
- Appear on pull sheet (`getProjectPullSheet` filters `type: "EQUIPMENT"`)
- A custom item inside a project group counts as an **extra** on top of the group's bundle price — it is not absorbed into the group total and no longer vanishes from the project total.

**Distinction from sub-hires:** Sub-hires represent formally ordered gear from a supplier with a structured order workflow. Custom items are anonymous ad-hoc entries with no supplier and no order tracking.

```

### Equipment Tab
- Flat table layout (`table-layout: fixed` with `<colgroup>`) — no card chrome
- Categories as collapsible row headers with tinted background
- Groups as collapsible table rows with edit button + dropdown menu, showing qty/price columns
- Line items indented under their parent group, drag-and-drop reorderable
- Single flat `DndContext` with prefixed IDs (categories, groups, items all in one context)
- Inline "Add Group" button in toolbar with template picker
- Uncategorized zone at the bottom holds orphan line items, orphan
  sub-hire groups, **and orphan project groups** (since v0.10.0.0) —
  fetched via `getUncategorizedProjectGroups` from
  [`src/server/category-slots.ts`](../src/server/category-slots.ts)
- Line item edit dialog; separate "Move to category" and "Move to group" dialogs (split in v0.9.3.0 — see [47-cross-type-equipment-unification.md](./47-cross-type-equipment-unification.md))
- Category rename (inline) and delete with cascade warning

### Financial Summary Sidebar
- Total with margin bar (green > 40%, amber 20-40%, red < 20%)
- Equipment revenue, discount, tax breakdown
- Services + Labour costs section
- Pricing progress indicator ("3/8 groups priced" in amber)
- Expandable audit trail breakdown (per-group pricing)

### Project Summary Strip
- Inline metrics strip between header and tabs (not stat cards per DESIGN.md)
- 4 metrics: Equipment revenue, Services (cost + count), Crew (cost + count), Total
- Responsive: 4-column on desktop, 2x2 grid on mobile
- Uses existing financial data + `getProjectServicesSummary()` + `getProjectLabourCost()`

### Labour & Logistics Tab
- Unified tab for services and crew (replaces separate Services/Crew tabs)
- Timeline view: services grouped by date with SectionHeader overline pattern
- Service cards show StatusIndicator pills, crew avatar stack (3 max + overflow), inline crew cost
- "Generate Services" button auto-creates services from project dates + service templates
- "Import Services" button clones services from another project with date offset
- Empty state with calendar preset and contextual CTA
- FadeIn/StaggerList motion animations

## Project Types
`DRY_HIRE, WET_HIRE, INSTALLATION, TOUR, CORPORATE, THEATRE, FESTIVAL, CONFERENCE, OTHER`

## Subhire
Line items with `isSubhire: true` and `supplierId` reference third-party equipment. `showSubhireOnDocs` controls visibility on client-facing PDFs.

## Kit & Prep-Kit Line Items
- Kit/prep-kit parent: `kitId` set, `isKitChild: false`
- Children: `isKitChild: true`, `parentLineItemId` pointing to parent
- Nested kits (kit inside prep-kit): child has its own `kitId` and `childLineItems`
- Queries must include 2 levels of `childLineItems` with `kit: true` for nested rendering
- See [Kits](./09-kits.md) and [Preps](./32-preps.md)

## Project Services
Structured operational tasks attached to a project (deliveries, pickups, bump in/out, labour, misc).

### Service Types
`DELIVERY, PICKUP, BUMP_IN, BUMP_OUT, LABOUR, MISC`

### Service Status Flow
`PLANNED → CONFIRMED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED` (any → `CANCELLED`)

### Key Behaviour
- Each service has its own date, time, address (for delivery/pickup), crew count, pricing
- `billableToClient` flag: when true, cost flows into project revenue instead of cost
- `costTotal` field for direct financial roll-up (no shadow line items)
- Services grouped by date in the UI

### Crew Integration
- Each service can optionally have a `crewRoleId` (FK to `CrewRole`) and `crewCountRequired`
- Service dialog includes crew role picker and searchable crew member multi-select
- `CrewAssignment` records auto-created with `serviceId` set
- Service type maps to assignment phase: DELIVERY→DELIVERY, PICKUP→PICKUP, etc.
- Deleting a service deletes all linked crew assignments
- Query invalidation ensures Crew and Services stay in sync

### Defaults from Project
- New services inherit the project location address/coordinates
- Date auto-fills based on service type

### Service Auto-Generation
- `generateProjectServices(projectId)` creates services from project dates + service templates
- Idempotent: checks existing services by type+date key to avoid duplicates on re-run
- Uses `isAutoAdded` templates; falls back to all active templates if none marked
- Default set if no templates: DELIVERY, BUMP_IN, BUMP_OUT, PICKUP (+ LABOUR show days if event dates)
- Multi-day events create one LABOUR service per day
- All wrapped in `prisma.$transaction()` for atomicity

### Service Cloning
- `cloneServicesFromProject(targetProjectId, sourceProjectId)` copies services between projects
- Calculates date offset from first service date difference
- Resets status to PLANNED, preserves crew preferences but not assignments

### Crew Auto-Suggest
- `getCrewSuggestionsForProject(projectId)` matches crew roles to equipment categories
- Uses `Category.suggestedCrewRoles` (string array of role IDs) for tag-based matching
- Returns matched crew roles + their members for assignment UI

### Crew Notifications
- `generateCrewMessage(projectId, crewMemberId)` builds copy-to-clipboard schedule message
- Includes venue, site contact, per-assignment schedule with dates/times/roles

### Service Cost History
- `getServiceCostHistory(organizationId, serviceType, limit)` returns historical pricing data

### Service Templates
- Managed in Settings → Services (`/settings/services`)
- `isAutoAdded` flag for templates that should be added to every new project

### Architecture
- All service mutations wrapped in `prisma.$transaction()` (atomicity)
- `buildServiceData()` DRY helper extracts ~20 shared fields between create and update
- `syncServiceLineItem()` auto-syncs line items with kit child guard + deleted item guard
- Cascade delete: always unlink line items, never delete them
- Shared constants in `src/lib/constants/services.ts`
- Partial unique index on `CrewAssignment(projectId, crewMemberId, serviceId) WHERE serviceId IS NOT NULL`

### Server Actions
- File: `src/server/project-services.ts`
- CRUD: `createProjectService`, `updateProjectService`, `deleteProjectService`, `getProjectServices`
- Status: `updateServiceStatus`, `bulkUpdateServiceStatus`
- Generation: `generateProjectServices`, `cloneServicesFromProject`, `convertLineItemToService`
- Crew: `getCrewSuggestionsForProject`, `generateCrewMessage`
- Templates: `createServiceTemplate`, `updateServiceTemplate`, `deleteServiceTemplate`, `getServiceTemplates`
- Financial: `getProjectServicesSummary`, `getServiceCostHistory`

### Day-of Runsheet
- Dedicated route: `/projects/[id]/runsheet`
- Mobile-first layout: no sidebar/tabs, compact header with venue directions
- Services grouped by date with crew lists per service
- Tappable phone numbers (tel: links) for site contact
- Link from project detail page "Runsheet" button

### Timeline PDF
- API route: `/api/documents/timeline/[projectId]`
- Portrait A4, date-grouped service rows with type/title/time/crew/cost
- Uses existing pdfme infrastructure (gearflowPageHeader/Footer plugins)
- Available via Documents dropdown on project detail page

## Duplicate Model Handling
Adding a model that already exists as a line item on the project **auto-merges** into the existing line item (increments quantity) by default. When a duplicate is detected, the add dialog presents a choice:
- **Combine with existing** (default) — merges quantity into the existing line item
- **Add as separate line item** — creates a new row via `forceSeparate` parameter

Sub-hire items (`isSubhire: true`) always create separate line items and never merge with own-stock items of the same model. The merge query matches on `modelId`, `groupId`, `categoryId`, and `isSubhire` to prevent cross-type merging.

## Project Templates
- `Project.isTemplate = true`. Templates use the same `Project` table but are completely isolated.
- `generateTemplateCode()` creates `TPL-0001`, `TPL-0002`, etc.
- Templates MUST be excluded from: dashboard stats, notifications, reports, search results, availability calendar, availability checks
- All project list queries: add `isTemplate: false` filter
- `updateProjectStatus()` rejects templates. `getProjectForWarehouse()` throws for templates.
- Duplication preserves full hierarchy: categories, groups, line items, services

## Project Deletion
Only cancelled projects can be deleted (`deleteProject` in `src/server/projects.ts`).

### Cleanup on Delete
1. **Reset checked-out assets**: All `CHECKED_OUT` serialized assets linked to project line items → `AVAILABLE`, restore default location
2. **Reset checked-out kits**: All `CHECKED_OUT` kits + their serialized assets → `AVAILABLE`, restore locations
3. **Delete prep-kits**: All `Kit` records with `isPrep: true` linked to this project are fully deleted
4. **Cascade**: `Project.delete()` cascades to all `ProjectLineItem`, `ProjectMedia`, etc.

## Server Action Files
- `src/server/projects.ts` — Project CRUD, duplication, status management
- `src/server/project-categories.ts` — Category CRUD, reorder
- `src/server/project-groups.ts` — Group CRUD, pricing, reorder, move items
- `src/server/project-managers.ts` — PM add/remove
- `src/server/group-templates.ts` — Template CRUD, save/apply
- `src/server/line-items.ts` — Line item CRUD, `recalculateProjectTotals()`
- `src/server/project-services.ts` — Service CRUD, templates
- `src/server/crew-assignments.ts` — Crew assignment management

## Validation Schemas
- `src/lib/validations/project.ts` — Project form (includes billingWeeks, billingDays, defaultRentalPeriod, defaultRentalQuantity, taxRate)
- `src/lib/validations/project-category.ts` — Category (name, sortOrder)
- `src/lib/validations/project-group.ts` — Group (categoryId, title, description, quantity, price, billingWeeks, billingDays, rentalPeriod, rentalQuantity)
- `src/lib/validations/group-template.ts` — Template (name, description, items[])
- `src/lib/validations/line-item.ts` — Line item (includes categoryId, groupId)
- `src/lib/validations/project-service.ts` — Service (includes billableToClient, costTotal)

## Operational P&L Panel
The project detail page has a right-rail costs panel (`src/components/projects/project-costs-panel.tsx`, server fn `getProjectOperationalCosts`). It shows revenue minus service / labour / sub-hire / maintenance / damage costs with a net-margin bar. Charge-back-aware: damage marked charged-back to the client is excluded from cost. Operational only — Xero owns invoicing. Hides itself when the project has no revenue.

## Reservation Conflict Resolution
When a serialized asset is booked on this project AND on another live project whose rental window overlaps, an amber banner (`src/components/projects/project-conflicts-banner.tsx`) surfaces on the project page. Each conflict row expands to a one-click swap picker of free same-model assets. The swap (`swapLineItemAsset`) re-checks free-in-window and reassigns inside one transaction, so a stale candidate can't push through a fresh double-booking. See `src/lib/reservation-conflicts.ts`.

## Future-Proofing
- **ROI Tracking**: Asset.purchasePrice supports revenue attribution against rental income — see [42. Asset Utilization](./42-asset-utilization.md)
- **Xero Integration**: Groups as line items + ungrouped standalone assets as separate line items
